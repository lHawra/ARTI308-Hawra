# Walmart Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Walmart Sales dataset. The analysis aims to investigate sales behavior across different stores and time periods, while examining the potential influence of external variables such as holidays, temperature, fuel price, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and unemployment rate on weekly sales performance.

The primary objective is to uncover meaningful patterns, statistical relationships, and seasonal trends that contribute to variations in sales outcomes.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Python in Google Colab and followed a structured EDA workflow:

- Data loading and inspection  
- Data type verification and date conversion  
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Descriptive statistical analysis  
- Distribution analysis of weekly sales  
- Comparative analysis of holiday vs non-holiday periods  
- Store-level performance analysis  
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables  
- Time series trend analysis  
- Monthly seasonal pattern evaluation

## Key Findings
- Weekly sales exhibit a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of high-revenue peak periods.  
- Sales tend to increase during holiday weeks compared to regular weeks.  
- There is substantial variation in total sales across stores, suggesting performance differences at the store level.  
- Correlation analysis shows weak linear relationships between weekly sales and macroeconomic indicators such as CPI and unemployment.  
- Time series analysis reveals noticeable fluctuations and recurring peak periods, indicating seasonal effects.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
The exploratory analysis demonstrates that sales performance is primarily influenced by store-level characteristics and temporal patterns rather than macroeconomic indicators. Seasonal trends and holiday periods contribute to observable fluctuations in weekly revenue. These findings provide a foundational understanding of sales behavior and can support future predictive modeling or business decision-making initiatives.
